# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to improve the mobile responsiveness of the clonal succession simulation by reorganizing the controls and statistics into a single horizontal row at the bottom of the canvas. This will create a more streamlined and space-efficient interface, particularly on mobile devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the simulation controls and statistics to be arranged in a single horizontal row at the bottom of the canvas, so that I can view all controls and data without scrolling on mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation is viewed on any device THEN all controls and statistics SHALL be displayed in a single horizontal row below the canvas
2. WHEN the simulation is viewed on mobile devices THEN the controls and statistics SHALL automatically adjust their size and spacing to fit the screen width
3. WHEN the screen width is too narrow to display all items in a single row THEN the controls and statistics SHALL wrap to additional rows in a logical order
4. WHEN the simulation is running THEN the controls and statistics SHALL remain visible and accessible at all times

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the most important controls and statistics to be prioritized in the layout, so that I can easily access the most commonly used features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the controls are displayed THEN the Reset button and Speed button SHALL be positioned first in the row
2. WHEN the statistics are displayed THEN the Total Cells count SHALL be positioned immediately after the control buttons
3. IF there is not enough space for all items in a single row THEN less frequently used controls and statistics SHALL wrap to subsequent rows
4. WHEN controls wrap to multiple rows THEN related controls SHALL be kept together

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the control layout to be visually consistent with the overall design of the simulation, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the controls are displayed THEN they SHALL use the same color scheme and styling as the rest of the simulation
2. WHEN the controls are displayed THEN they SHALL have appropriate spacing and padding for touch interaction
3. WHEN the controls are displayed THEN they SHALL have consistent heights and visual weights
4. WHEN hovering over or clicking controls THEN they SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the control layout changes to be implemented using the existing mobile-responsive.css file, so that the code remains maintainable and follows the project's structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the feature THEN changes SHALL be made primarily to the mobile-responsive.css file
2. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the HTML structure in clonal-succession-cycle.html SHALL be modified as needed
3. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the changes SHALL follow the guidelines in MOBILE_RESPONSIVE_GUIDE.md
4. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the changes SHALL NOT break existing functionality
