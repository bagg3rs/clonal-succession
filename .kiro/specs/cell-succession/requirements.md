# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Cell Succession feature aims to enhance the clonal succession simulation by implementing a more biologically accurate model of stem cell activation, division, and population dynamics. This feature will improve the visualization and mechanics of how tumor cell populations maintain themselves through cycles of stem cell activation and clonal expansion, focusing on the succession process where new stem cells activate as older populations decline. Additionally, this feature will include cleaning up the animations folder to remove unnecessary files and retain only the most useful and relevant animations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Stem Cell Activation and Suppression

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to visualize the stem cell activation and suppression mechanisms, so that I can better understand how dormant stem cells become activated when the current active population declines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the active cell population begins to decline THEN the system SHALL gradually reduce the suppression signal strength
2. WHEN the suppression signal drops below a threshold AND there are dormant stem cells available THEN the system SHALL activate a new stem cell
3. WHEN a new stem cell is activated THEN the system SHALL visually highlight this activation event
4. WHEN an active stem cell is producing a population THEN the system SHALL display a suppression field affecting dormant stem cells
5. IF multiple dormant stem cells exist THEN the system SHALL select one for activation based on defined criteria (proximity to resources, random selection, etc.)

### Requirement 2: Population Dynamics and Homeostasis

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to observe realistic population dynamics with homeostasis, so that I can study how tumors maintain a stable total cell count despite individual cell populations having limited lifespans.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation is running THEN the system SHALL maintain a total cell population close to the defined maximum (approximately 100 cells)
2. WHEN a new clone begins expanding THEN the system SHALL ensure it replaces the declining population rather than simply adding to the total
3. WHEN cells reach their division limit THEN the system SHALL transition them through appropriate states (dividing → non-dividing → senescent)
4. WHEN senescent cells die THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate signals that contribute to new stem cell activation
5. IF the total population drops significantly below the target THEN the system SHALL accelerate the activation of new stem cells

### Requirement 3: Visual Representation of Clonal Succession

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want clear visual differentiation between cell populations and states, so that I can easily track the succession process and population changes over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cells belong to different clones THEN the system SHALL display them with distinct colors (red, green, yellow)
2. WHEN cells transition between states THEN the system SHALL update their visual appearance accordingly
3. WHEN a new clone activates THEN the system SHALL provide a visual indicator of the succession event
4. WHEN the simulation is running THEN the system SHALL display real-time statistics about each clone's population
5. IF a cell is a stem cell THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish it from regular cells

### Requirement 4: Configurable Succession Parameters

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to adjust key parameters of the succession process, so that I can experiment with different scenarios and study their effects on tumor maintenance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the simulation controls THEN the system SHALL provide adjustable parameters for stem cell activation threshold
2. WHEN accessing the simulation controls THEN the system SHALL provide adjustable parameters for suppression signal strength
3. WHEN accessing the simulation controls THEN the system SHALL provide adjustable parameters for cell division limits
4. WHEN parameters are adjusted THEN the system SHALL immediately apply these changes to the simulation
5. IF parameters are set to extreme values THEN the system SHALL provide feedback about potential biological unrealism

### Requirement 5: Data Collection and Analysis

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to collect data on population dynamics over time, so that I can analyze patterns and trends in the succession process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation is running THEN the system SHALL track and display the population count of each clone over time
2. WHEN a succession event occurs THEN the system SHALL record the timing and circumstances of the event
3. WHEN the simulation completes THEN the system SHALL provide summary statistics of population dynamics
4. IF the user requests it THEN the system SHALL provide an option to export simulation data for external analysis
5. WHEN viewing the simulation THEN the system SHALL display a timeline of key events in the succession process

### Requirement 6: Animation Folder Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up the animations folder by removing unnecessary files, so that the codebase is more maintainable and only contains relevant animations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the animations folder THEN the system SHALL identify which animations are essential to the project
2. WHEN cleaning up the animations folder THEN the system SHALL remove redundant or experimental animations that are no longer needed
3. WHEN organizing animations THEN the system SHALL ensure that only useful animations are retained
4. WHEN removing animations THEN the system SHALL ensure no references to these files exist elsewhere in the codebase
5. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL have a well-organized animations folder with only the necessary files

### Requirement 7: Web-Based Contribution Setup

**User Story:** As a potential contributor with limited access, I want to be able to contribute to the project using only GitHub.com and VS Code on the web, so that I can participate without needing to install software locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new contributor visits the repository THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for using VS Code on the web
2. WHEN setting up the contribution workflow THEN the system SHALL ensure all necessary steps can be completed through the GitHub.com interface
3. WHEN documenting the setup process THEN the system SHALL include screenshots or visual guides for web-based contribution
4. WHEN a contributor follows the setup guide THEN the system SHALL enable them to make changes, test, and submit contributions entirely through the web interface
5. IF a contributor has limited technical resources THEN the system SHALL provide alternative contribution paths that don't require local development environments
