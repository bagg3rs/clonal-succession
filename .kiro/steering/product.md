# Clonal Succession in Tumors

## Product Overview
This project is an interactive physics-based simulation that demonstrates how tumors maintain their cell populations through cycles of stem cell activation and clonal expansion. The simulation visualizes the process of clonal succession, which allows tumors to persist despite individual cell populations having limited lifespans.

## Key Concepts

### Clonal Succession Process
1. **Stem Cell Activation**: One stem cell becomes active and suppresses others
2. **Clonal Expansion**: Active stem cell produces a large population of identical cells
3. **Population Decline**: Cells reach division limit and begin to die off
4. **Succession Event**: As suppression weakens, a new stem cell activates
5. **Cycle Repeats**: New clone expands while suppressing others

### Core Mechanisms
- **Population Homeostasis**: Tumor maintains ~100 cells total
- **Three-Clone System**: Red, green, and yellow clones cycle through activation
- **Suppression System**: Active clones suppress dormant stem cells
- **Cell Lifecycle**: Cells transition from dividing → non-dividing → senescent → death
