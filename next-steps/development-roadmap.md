# Development Roadmap: Clonal Succession Project

## Next Steps for Tomorrow

### Animation Updates Needed
1. **Constant Population**
   - Maintain exactly 100 cells total
   - New cells only appear as old ones die
   - Track and display population balance

2. **Three-Color System**
   - Add yellow stem cell and clone
   - Position stem cells in triangular arrangement
   - Implement three-way suppression system

3. **Improved Visualization**
   - Show clear cell replacement events
   - Add population composition graph
   - Display active/suppressed state of each stem cell

### Questions to Explore
1. How does the timing of clone activation affect the pattern?
2. What determines which clone becomes dominant?
3. How do the three clones interact and suppress each other?
4. What triggers the switch from one clone to another?
