# Getting Started with Clonal Succession Project

## Quick Start

Welcome to the Clonal Succession project! This repository contains research, models, and visualizations for understanding how tumors maintain their populations through clonal succession mechanisms.

## Understanding the Research

### Start Here: Core Concept
The clonal succession model explains how tumors survive despite individual cell populations having limited lifespans. Key insights:

1. **Population Homeostasis**: Tumors maintain constant cell counts (~100 cells)
2. **Stem Cell Cycling**: Three stem cells take turns being active
3. **Suppression Mechanism**: Active clones suppress dormant ones
4. **Replacement Strategy**: New clones replace old ones, not add to them

### Read the Documentation
1. **README.md** - Overview of the entire project
2. **docs/research-notes.md** - Detailed findings and implications
3. **docs/biological-basis.md** - Scientific background and validation
4. **models/mathematical-framework.md** - Mathematical formulation

## Development Priorities

### Immediate Tasks (This Week)
Based on the next-steps documentation, focus on:

1. **Animation System**
   - Implement constant population (100 cells)
   - Add three-color clone system (red, green, yellow)
   - Create suppression visualization
   - Add real-time population tracking

2. **Model Validation**
   - Test mathematical framework
   - Validate against biological literature
   - Document assumptions and limitations

### Next Steps (1-2 Weeks)
1. **Interactive Features**
   - Parameter controls for growth rates
   - Suppression strength adjustments
   - Speed controls for animation

2. **Data Integration**
   - Import experimental observations
   - Statistical analysis tools
   - Parameter estimation methods

## Technical Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ for mathematical modeling
- JavaScript/HTML5 for web animations
- Git for version control
- Modern web browser for visualization

### Recommended Tools
- **Python**: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib for modeling
- **JavaScript**: D3.js or Canvas API for animations
- **Documentation**: Markdown editors
- **Analysis**: Jupyter notebooks for exploration

## Key Research Questions

### Immediate Questions
1. How precise is the population homeostasis mechanism?
2. What determines the timing of clone succession?
3. How do the three clones interact and suppress each other?

### Long-term Questions
1. Can this mechanism be therapeutically targeted?
2. How does this contribute to tumor persistence?
3. Do different tumor types show similar patterns?
