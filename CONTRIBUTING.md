## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and considerate of others when contributing to this project. We aim to foster an inclusive and welcoming community.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine
3. **Set up the development environment** by following instructions in GETTING_STARTED.md

## Issue and Pull Request Workflow

### Creating Issues

1. Before starting work, check if an issue already exists for the bug or feature
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - Clear title describing the problem or feature
   - Detailed description with steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Screenshots or mockups (if applicable)
   - Any relevant context

### Working on Issues

1. Comment on the issue to express your interest in working on it
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/add-new-animation
   ```
   or
   ```
   git checkout -b fix/mobile-responsive-bug
   ```

### Creating Pull Requests

1. Make your changes in your branch
2. Commit with clear, descriptive messages
3. Push your branch to your fork
4. Create a pull request with:
   - Reference to the issue it addresses
   - Description of changes made
   - Any testing performed
   - Screenshots (if applicable)

### Linking Issues with Pull Requests

**Important:** To automatically close issues when your PR is merged, include one of these keywords in your PR title or description:

- `closes #issue-number`
- `fixes #issue-number`
- `resolves #issue-number`

Multiple issues can be referenced:
```
This PR fixes #123 and closes #456
```

When your PR is merged into the main branch, GitHub will automatically close the referenced issues.

### Example Workflow

1. Find issue #42: "Add mobile responsive controls"
2. Create branch: `feature/mobile-responsive-controls`
3. Make changes and commit
4. Create PR with title: "Add mobile responsive controls, fixes #42"
5. When merged, issue #42 will automatically close

## Development Process

1. **Branch naming conventions**:
   - `feature/` - for new features
   - `fix/` - for bug fixes
   - `docs/` - for documentation changes
   - `refactor/` - for code refactoring

2. **Commit messages** should follow the Gitmoji convention:
   ```
   <gitmoji> <type>: <description>
   ```
   
   For example:
   ```
   ‚ú® feat: add mobile responsive controls for small screens
   ```
   
   See the [Gitmoji Convention](#gitmoji-convention) section below for more details.

3. **Pull Request reviews**:
   - All PRs require at least one review
   - Address review comments before merging

## Coding Standards

- Follow existing code style in the repository
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

## Testing

- Test your changes thoroughly before submitting a PR
- Add or update tests for new features
- Ensure all existing tests pass

## Documentation

- Update documentation affected by your changes
- Add comments to your code
- Update README.md if necessary

Thank you for contributing to the Clonal Succession project!

## Gitmoji Convention

To ensure consistent and informative version control, we use the Gitmoji convention for commit messages. This provides a visual indication of the commit purpose and makes the commit history more readable.

### Commit Format

All commit messages should follow this format:
```
<gitmoji> <type>: <description>
```

For example:
```
‚ú® feat: add stem cell visualization
```

### Commit Structure

1. **Subject Line**: Brief description (50 chars or less) with gitmoji and type
2. **Body** (optional): Detailed explanation of changes when needed
3. **Footer** (optional): Reference issues or breaking changes

Example of a complete commit message:
```
‚ú® feat: implement stem cell activation mechanism

Add logic to detect when suppression drops below threshold and activate
a new stem cell. Includes visual indicator for activation events.

Closes #42
```

### Gitmoji Reference Table

| Emoji | Code | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| ‚ú® | `:sparkles:` | Introducing new features | `‚ú® feat: add stem cell visualization` |
| üêõ | `:bug:` | Fixing a bug | `üêõ fix: correct cell division logic` |
| üìù | `:memo:` | Adding or updating documentation | `üìù docs: update README with new features` |
| ‚ôªÔ∏è | `:recycle:` | Refactoring code | `‚ôªÔ∏è refactor: simplify cell lifecycle management` |
| üé® | `:art:` | Improving structure/format of the code | `üé® style: format simulation code` |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è | `:zap:` | Improving performance | `‚ö°Ô∏è perf: optimize cell rendering` |
| üî• | `:fire:` | Removing code or files | `üî• chore: remove unused animation files` |
| üß™ | `:test_tube:` | Adding tests | `üß™ test: add tests for stem cell activation` |
| üöö | `:truck:` | Moving or renaming files | `üöö chore: reorganize animation folder` |

### Commit Frequency

1. **Atomic Commits**: Make small, focused commits that address a single concern
2. **Logical Boundaries**: Commit after completing each logical task or component
3. **Working State**: Ensure the codebase is in a working state after each commit

### Branch Management

1. **Feature Branches**: Create a branch for each feature or fix
2. **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive names with prefixes (e.g., `feature/stem-cell-activation`)
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep branches up-to-date with the main branch
4. **Clean History**: Use interactive rebase to clean up commit history before merging
